# Antarctica_penguins

## Dataset description
Focuses on three species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) found in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. 
It contains biological and physical measurements by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

The dataset includes the following attributes:

Species: The species of the penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo). <br>
Island: The island in the Palmer Archipelago where the penguin was observed (e.g., Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream). <br>
Bill Length (mm): Length of the penguin's bill. <br>
Bill Depth (mm): Depth of the penguin's bill. <br>
Flipper Length (mm): Length of the penguin's flipper. <br>
Body Mass (g): Body mass of the penguin. <br>
Sex: The sex of the penguin (male or female). <br>
Year: The year when the data was collected.
